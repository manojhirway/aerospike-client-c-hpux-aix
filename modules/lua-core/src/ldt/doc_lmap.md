-- LMAP Design and Type Comments:
--=============================================================================
--
-- What is LMAP ?
-- 
-- It is a complex type (it includes infrastructure that is used by
-- server storage), so it can only be viewed or manipulated by Lua and C
-- functions on the server.  It is represented by a Lua MAP object that
-- comprises control information and a set of record bins that contain
-- fixed-sized list of digests which directly point to a record. LMAP can be
-- viewed as a version of LSET object which points to a fixed-size warm-list
-- of digests, instead of having a Lset control-bin pointing to a map object 
-- and additional Lset bins (1 to N) each pointing to list-values. 
-- The LMAP object does not have a separate control-bin and value-bins.
-- We just have one direct LMAP bin object. 
--
-- Advantages over LSET :
--
-- 1. Lmap gets rid of a separate control-bin, instead control-information is 
--    at the top of each lmap map. 
-- 2. Lmap achieves vertical-scaling by having a list of digests, each of which
--    points to a LDR, instead of a list of values. 
-- 3. Users can add as many lmap-type bins to a record and customize the names
--    of the records. In the case of LSET, there can be only one lset-type bin
--    in a record and their names are fixed.
--
-- Enhancements to LMAP :
-- 
-- 1. New: 
--    Each top-record containing an lmap-bin will have a property-map that is 
--    common to the entire record. 
-- 2. New: 
--    Each lmap bin will also have a LDT bin-specific property map.   
-- 3. New: 
--    There will be a separate existence sub-record (ESR) that indicates 
--    whether a list of LDT child-records are valid or not. 
-- 4. Modification: 
--    The LMAP control-bin which was a simple map earlier has now been changed
--    into a list. 
--    a. The first entry of the list contains the ldt-bin specific 
--    property map referred in item 2. 
--    b. The second entry of the list contains the original lsomap which has been
--    a map of standard lmap attributes and their values 
-- 5. Modification: 
--    Abbreviated names for the lmap record attributes to save storage space
--
--    ******************  Description copied-over from lstack.lua *********
--
----   + Since Lua wraps up the LDT Control map as a self-contained object,
--     we are paying for storage in EACH LDT Bin for the map field names. 
--     Thus, even though we like long map field names for readability:
--     e.g.  lsoMap.HotEntryListItemCount, we don't want to spend the
--     space to store the large names in each and every LDT control map.
--     So -- we do another Lua Trick.  Rather than name the key of the
--     map value with a large name, we instead use a single character to
--     be the key value, but define a descriptive variable name to that
--     single character.  So, instead of using this in the code:
--     lsoMap.ListItemCount = 50;
--            123456789012345678901
--     (which would require 21 bytes of storage); We instead do this:
--     local ListItemCount='C';
--     lsoMap[ListItemCount] = 50;
--     Now, we're paying the storage cost for 'C' (1 byte) and the value.
--
--     So -- we have converted all of our LDT lua code to follow this
--     convention (fields become variables the reference a single char)
--     and the mapping of long name to single char will be done in the code.

-- How does LMAP insertion work ?
--
-- The Large Map data structure has a control-bin (with a user-defined name) 
-- which points to a list of digests. 
-- 
-- a. In the compact mode, there is only one LMAP bin pointing to a list of N
--    LDR entries, directly placed as a list like a LSET structure. In this 
--    mode, we simply append the record to the end of the singular list. 
-- 
-- b. When we reach lmapCtrlInfo[M_ThreshHold] or more items in the compact
--    mode, we switch to the regular or standard mode. 
-- 
-- c. As a part of this switch, we first create a list of M_Modulo entries 
--    which are all zeroed out initially. Later-on, they will become a list of
--    digests each of which point to one LDR entry. 
-- 
-- d. Also as a part of the switch, we create a new LDR chunk, initialize the 
--    property-map attributes for this LDR. We also create and initialize one 
--    and only one Exists-Sub-Record per LMAP-bin. Then we fill-in this LDR 
--    with the list we copied over from the first-bin. 
-- 
-- e. After we are done bulding the LDR entirely, it is now time to insert the 
--    appropriate digest-list entry in LMAP with the digest-value of this LDR
--    
--    Digest_List[Index] = Digest of LDR x --------> LDR x
--    
-- f. So how does this step happen ? Every LDT-bin has a key-type field which 
--    specifies if its key-type is atomic or complex. If the key-type field is
--    atomic, it would be a simple integer or string hash. If the key-type is 
--    complex, the user would also have to give us a function-table to compute
--    this number. This hash is used to determine the index in the digest-list
--    for the digest pointer entry. 
-- 
-- g. After the switch, normal lmap_inserts also go through the same hashing
--    described above to perform insertions of elements. 
-- 
-- h. In the standard mode, there are multiple LMAP bins in a record. When 
--    an LDR needss to be inserted, we first pick the matching lmap bin-name
--    and then proceed to hashing the object and finding its place in the list. 
-- 
-- i. What are some bounds on the lmap_insert ?
-- *  For starters, when in compact mode, we can only insert upto M_Threshold
--      after which we can only continue in regular-mode 
-- *  If we are in regular-mode, how many entries will each LDR list (pointed 
--    to by a single digest have a max of ? That is determined by the M_Topfull
--    variable that is actually a ldt-bin level attribute but it gets set and 
--    reset for every LDR entry-list overflow. 
--
-- h.1 Note the distinction between StoreState vs StoreMode: StoreMode, as a
--     SM_LIST or SM_BINARY is present for both LSET and LSTACK. But StoreState
--     which determines whether the LDT is operating in compact or standard 
--     mode is present only for LSET and NOT in LSTACK. In the case of LSTACK
--        the transfer-count and overflow counters acts as rehashing techniques. 
--     Since LMAP is a hybrid LSET + Warm-list LDT, it has both the defines. 
--     LMAP however does not have any Transfer metric, because there is no 
--     notion of a transfer or overflow in LMAP. As in the case of LSET, the
--     attribute that determines this switch will be LMAP threashold. Also 
--     this will be a property of the LDT-bin specific control-information. 
-- 
-- i. Unlike lstack which grows as a list but is read in reverse as a stack, 
--    lmap digest entries are meant to behave as a simple, oops hashed linear
--    list. So a lmap search is very much similar to the lset-search of hash-matching, 
--       except that in the case of lset, we would hash to find the correct bin, 
--    but in the case of lmap, we look-up by bin-name, but hash to find the 
--    digest entry amongst the list-indices (in the case of standard mode) or
--    hash to find the actual entry index itself (in the case of compact mode. 
--  
-- j. Note another subtle-difference between LMAP and LSTACK in terms of 
--    insertion of entries (also applicable in reverse for search). 
--    In the case of LSTACK, we simply add the new digest to the list of 
--    warm-digests. In the case of LMAP, we take the digest of the top-most
--    entry in our ldr-list-bin, obtain the list-entry corresponding to it,
--    hash this list-entry over M_Modulo digest-bins and then insert the 
--    digest into that index pointing to the top of LDR list of entries.
--       LSTACK appends digests to a list, LMAP hashes over M_Modulo to obtain
--    this result. 
-- 
-- k. There is also no notion of a TOP in LMAP unlike LMAP. In stack, the top
--    is determined to be top-most or most-recent index in the digest-list
--    entry. This is the index at which the next LDR entry would be inserted. 
--    In the case of LMAP, we first pick the digest-list index using the hash
--    method described above. If that entry in the digest-list is nil, we go
--    ahead and call a lmapLdrListChunkCreate() and also insert the bin. If 
--    it is non-empty, we go ahead and directly call listInsert().     
-- 
--    How does LMAP deletion work ?
-- 
-- a. In compact mode, deletion is similar to LSET functionality, we simply 
--    pick-up the user-defined bin and delete the entry from the list of
--    entries. We also update stats. DO NOT DELETE THE SUBREC FOR LMAP_DELETE. 

-- b. In regular mode, the when an entry needs to be deleted, we first 
--    determine whether the lmapbinname exists. If it does, we first hash
--    the entry to point to a digest-list index. 
-- 
-- c. This digest-list can either be the digest pointing to the LDR entry
--    or it can point to the list of entries, one of which contains the entry
--    we want to delete. We wont be able to differentiate between the two. So
--    we go thorugh the LDR list pointed-to by the digest, look for the item 
--    and delete the item.  
-- 
-- c.1 How should the digest-list be updated for this delete. If there was only
--     one entry in the LDR list and that item was removed, we remove the 
--     digest-list entry. If the deleted entry was one among many, nothing 
--     needs to be done with respect to the digest-list. 
-- 
-- d. Should we reset M_TopFull to false here ? Probably. If its set 
--    to true, no harm in resetting it back to false. 
-- 
-- e. For all cases, we copy over the list, delete the entry and re-attach 
--    the new list back to the digest-entry. Again, we must remember that 
--    lmap deletion is DELINKING. DO NOT DELETE THE SUBREC FOR LMAP_DELETE.
-- 
--       How does LMAP search work ?
-- 
-- a. In compact mode, LMAP search is similar to LSET. We simply scan through
--       the first and only lmap-bin-name and return 0 if the element is found or
--    return an error if the element is not found in the set or if the lmap bin
--    name does not at all exist on the system. When the search-value is not 
--    specified, we return all the elemnets of the first and only bin. 
-- 
-- b. In regular mode search, we first check for the existence of the bin. If 
--    it does, we first hash the search-entry to a matching digest-list index. 
--    Then we look through the digest-list, find the ldr-list pointed to by the
--    digest-entry. If the entry is found, we return 0, if not we return error. 
--    When the search value is not specified, we return all the list-elemnts 
--    pointed-to by all the digest-list entries in their ldr-list for the given
--    lmapBinName.
